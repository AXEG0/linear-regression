## What:
This code generates a synthetic dataset with imbalanced classes, splits it into training and testing sets, and trains four logistic regression models: a standard model, a balanced model, a model with under-sampled training data, and a calibrated model. It then evaluates each model using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC) and Brier scores, and prints the results.
